# earthanalytics-workshop
The workshop provides you an understanding of AWS services in data ingestion, data processing and machine learning for earth analytics. In this workshop you will build a machine learning (ML) model for binary classification to detect cloud cover and identify the amount of cloud cover in a satellite image. The model will be trained using pre-labeled data. You can bring their own imagery to validate the modelâ€™s response or use the imagery provided the "test-datasets" folder. Additionally, you can use data from Open Data Registry on AWS. The workshop will use AWS services like Amazon SageMaker to train and deploy ML models, SageMaker Jupyter notebooks to visualize the inputs and outputs, AWS Glue / lambda to pre-process the data and optionally AWS Open Data registry to ingest data from public datasets.
